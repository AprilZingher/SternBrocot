# Handoff

One section per queue item. Everything claimed here was checked by `lake build`
from the repo root; every named theorem below was checked with `#print axioms`
and depends only on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.

## Environment note (read first)

The container came up with **no Lean toolchain at all** — no `elan`, no `lake`,
no `.lake/`. Install with

```
sh <(curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh) \
   -y --default-toolchain leanprover/lean4:v4.32.2
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"      # elan is NOT on the default PATH here
lake exe cache get && lake build
```

`lake exe cache get` makes two passes; the first (against the `mathlib4-master`
bucket) downloads 0 files and that is normal — the second, against `mathlib4`,
gets all 8639.

`Mathlib.Data.Real.Irrational` **does not exist** in this Mathlib revision.
`Irrational` lives in `Mathlib.NumberTheory.Real.Irrational`.

## Item 1 — COMPLETED

New file `SternBrocot/Convergent.lean` (585 lines, no `sorry`), plus a section
at the end of `Examples.lean`. Wired into `SternBrocot.lean`.

### What was proved

Infrastructure:

* `prefixWord x n` — the first `n` bits of the path, as a word;
  `applyPath_prefixWord` puts them back: `applyPath (prefixWord x n) (σⁿ x) = x`.
  This is `exists_applyPath` with the word made explicit, which is what lets us
  name the matrix.
* `matMul`, `pathMat_append`, `pathMat_replicate_true/false` — words concatenate,
  matrices multiply, and a run of length `a` is one of the two elementary
  matrices to the `a`.
* `toReal₀_eq_mobius_prefixWord` — `Φ₀ x = (A s + B)/(C s + D)` for
  `s = Φ₀ (σⁿ x)` and `(A,B,C,D) = pathMat (prefixWord x n)`. The only analytic
  input in the file; everything else is algebra and bookkeeping.

Irrationality, which is the standing hypothesis:

* `toReal₀_univ : Φ₀ univ = 0` — names the junk value at `∞` (the cut is
  unbounded and `Real.sSup` returns `0`). Was missing and is needed to rule out
  `x = univ` from irrationality.
* `iterate_shift_ne_univ_of_irrational` — no shift of an irrational path is `∞`.
* `irrational_toReal₀_iterate_shift` — irrationality passes to every tail.
* `toReal₀_pos_of_irrational` — hence every tail value is `> 0`, which is what
  makes the second estimate strict rather than `≤`.

(a) Run-boundary extraction:

* `InfFlips x` — the path flips infinitely often.
* `infFlips_of_irrational` — **the "infinite exactly when irrational" half**,
  via `eventuallyConstant_iff_rat`. The converse direction is not stated because
  it is not needed; a rational path stops flipping, and `EventuallyConstant` is
  already the right statement of that.
* `nextFlip`, `runBoundary`, `partialQuot`, `runBit`, with
  `bitAt_eq_of_lt_nextFlip` (the run is constant — minimality of `sInf`),
  `runBit_succ` (runs alternate), `partialQuot_pos`.
* `prefixWord_runBoundary_succ` — the prefix at boundary `k+1` is the prefix at
  boundary `k` followed by `List.replicate (partialQuot x k) (runBit x k)`.

(b) The recurrence:

* `contin x k = (pₖ, qₖ)` with `contin_num_add_two` / `contin_den_add_two` the
  recurrences `pₖ₊₂ = aₖ pₖ₊₁ + pₖ`, `qₖ₊₂ = aₖ qₖ₊₁ + qₖ`.
* `boundaryMat_eq_contin` — **the load-bearing theorem**: at run boundary `k+1`
  the two columns of `pathMat` of the prefix are `contin x (k+1)` and
  `contin x (k+2)`, in an order that alternates with `runBit x k`. This is where
  the recurrence comes from `pathMat`, as the queue asked.

(c) The estimates:

* `contin_den_pos` — `qₖ > 0` for `k ≥ 2`.
* `contin_den_le_succ` — **`qₖ ≤ qₖ₊₁` for `k ≥ 1`**.
* `abs_sub_columns_lt` — both columns of *any* prefix matrix approximate `Φ₀ x`
  to within `1/(C D)`, strictly.
* `abs_sub_contin_lt` — **`|Φ₀ x − pₖ/qₖ| < 1/(qₖ qₖ₊₁)`** for `k ≥ 2`.
* `abs_sub_contin_lt_one_div_sq` — the `1/q²` form.

Example (in `Examples.lean`), pinning the definitions to intent:

* `partialQuot_goldenPath : partialQuot {n | Even n} k = 1` — every partial
  quotient of `φ` is `1`.
* `contin_goldenPath : contin {n | Even n} (k+1) = (fib (k+1), fib k)` — the
  continuants are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. `contin` is built from run
  boundaries of a bit set and `Nat.fib` is defined in Mathlib with no reference
  to any of it, so this is a real check that the run decomposition computes the
  classical continued fraction. With `toReal₀_goldenPath` it says the
  convergents of `φ` are `1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, …`.

### Remaining `sorry`s

None.

### The GenContFract question — decided: REBUILD, do not bridge

Measured rather than guessed.

* **Rebuild, actual cost:** the estimates section is 92 lines end to end
  (`column_errors` 12, `abs_sub_columns_lt` 30, the two convergent corollaries
  ~30, prose the rest). The whole file is 585 lines including the run
  decomposition, which the bridge would *also* need.
* **Bridge, cost:** Mathlib's `abs_sub_convs_le` is stated for
  `GenContFract.of v`, which is built from `IntFractPair.stream` — i.e. from
  `⌊v⌋` and `Int.fract`. Using it requires proving
  `partialQuot x k = (GenContFract.of (Φ₀ x)).partDens k` modulo the index
  shift, which means redoing the `toReal₀_S`/`toReal₀_L` analysis in the floor
  language, and then translating `continuantsAux` (different indexing, stated
  over a general `LinearOrderedField`, side conditions in terms of
  `TerminatedAt`) into this one. `Computation/Approximations.lean` alone is 491
  lines and `CorrectnessTerminating.lean` another 242; the bridge is the size of
  the thing it would save.
* Mathlib's estimate is also **non-strict** (`≤ 1/(bₙ bₙ₊₁)`) where the one
  proved here is strict, and strictness is what Hurwitz's three-convergent
  argument consumes.

The deciding fact is that the expensive half of this file is the run
decomposition, and bridging does not avoid it: `GenContFract.of` knows nothing
about bit paths, so the run lengths have to be identified with its partial
quotients either way. Rebuilding keeps the development self-contained and
drags no continued-fraction API into the import closure.

### Indexing — read before using this file

`contin x 0` and `contin x 1` are the seeds `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`, **swapped when
the path starts with a left move**. That swap *is* the classical `a₀ = 0`: for
`x < 1` the tree stores no leading `R`-run, so the whole sequence shifts by one.
With it, one recurrence serves both `x ≥ 1` and `x < 1`. The cost is that
`contin x k` is a genuine convergent only for `k ≥ 2`, and `q₁ = 0`. Every
estimate is therefore stated at `k + 2`. Do not "fix" this by special-casing
`x < 1`; the swap is the fix.

### What the next person should do first

Nothing is blocked. The natural next consumers are Hurwitz (item 2) and the hard
half of Lagrange (item 4), both of which want one thing this file does not yet
provide: the **exact** error, not just the bound. It is already sitting inside
`column_errors`, which proves

  `t − B/D = s/(D(Cs+D))`   and   `A/C − t = 1/(C(Cs+D))`

exactly, and then throws the equalities away. Hurwitz needs
`|t − pₖ/qₖ| = 1/(qₖ(qₖ w + qₖ₊₁))` where `w` is `s` or `1/s` according to
`runBit`. Promoting `column_errors` from `private` and exposing that identity is
the first job, and it is a re-statement, not a new proof.
